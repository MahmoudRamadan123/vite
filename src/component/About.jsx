                About the Texas Health Insurance Marketplace</h1>
                <p>Texas is one of several states in the U.S. that uses the federal health insurance marketplace under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This marketplace is called Healthcare.gov. We are not affiliated with Healthcare.gov, and we are not a health insurance company. We can, however, connect you with multiple Texas health insurance providers and brokers, giving you a streamlined way to compare your stateâ€™s options all in one place. These options include both marketplace plans, also known as "Obamacare," and non-government plans. By filling out a few pieces of information about yourself, we can match you to the best plan that suits your personal needs.</p>

            <h1>Do I Qualify for a Plan?</h1>
            <p>In order to get an Obamacare Plan, you must sign up during Open Enrollment. If you missed Open Enrollment, you can still get an Obamacare plan during Special Enrollment. You qualify for Special Enrollment if you, or someone in your household, recently experienced certain life events -- such as losing health coverage, changing jobs, getting married/divorced, having a child, or moving, to name a few</p>
